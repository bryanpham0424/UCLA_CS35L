Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change

1. Command: [git clone link diffutils-hw]
	I decided to make another clone of the repository to ensure that everything is the same as the one from the website. Additionally, I didn't want to potentially
	change anything from my previous work in case I need to go back to it.

2. Command: [git checkout v3.0 -b quote]
	Creates a new branch called 'quote' at the current commit.

3. Command: [patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt]
	Installs previously created patch. The output to standard out was:
	
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. Command: [emacs file_name] [C-x 4 a]
	This creates a change log for each of the files from the previous step.

5. Command [git add .] [git commit -F ChangeLog]
	This adds all the files to the index. The second command commits the change to the branch.



-------------- Side Note --------------

So when I initially ran these commands above, I wasn't sure what to expect. The output was: 

[quote 407a41b] 2020-12-08  Bryan Long Pham  <classpha@lnxsrv11.seas.ucla.edu>

Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly. Run the
following command and follow the instructions in your editor to edit
your configuration file:

    git config --global --edit

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 7 files changed, 57 insertions(+), 52 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 #ChangeLog#

However, I opened the ChangeLog itself in emacs, and I realized that I actually didn't put a message in about he commit. So I went back
and added a message to it, and reused the same commands. The output was:

[quote 912e9be] 2020-12-08  Bryan Long Pham  <classpha@lnxsrv11.seas.ucla.edu>
 Committer: Bryan Long Pham <classpha@lnxsrv11.seas.ucla.edu>

 1 file changed, 5 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 #ChangeLog#

So I believe that the correct commit is the one prior to this one, although I'm not sure, and I'm not confident enough to use [git reset]
to revert changes.

-------------- End of  Side Note --------------


6. Command: [git am < ../formatted-patch.txt]

I'm not sure if this has to do with what happened in the previous step, but I received a message saying:

Applying: 2020-12-08 Bryan Long Pham <classpha@lnxsrv11.seas.ucla.edu>
error: #ChangeLog#: does not exist in index
Patch failed at 0001 2020-12-08 Bryan Long Pham <classpha@lnxsrv11.seas.ucla.edu>
When you have resolved this problem run "git am --resolved".
If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git am --skip".
To restore the original branch and stop patching run "git am --abort".

The #Changelog# file was there before I performed the second [git commit]. I am unable to continue and I can't figure out why.
I was unable to then perform the verificaton of my patch working, and also was unable to verify if my changelog worked.

7. Describe the merge point and the subwindows and what they do:

[cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L], [gitk] to run gitk on the specified GNU
Emacs git repo

XQuartz now opens with the visualization of the master branch details.

First of all, the newest merge that is not newer than 1/25/15 was made on 
1/25/15 at 23:56:37, made by Trevor Murphy

There are a few subwindows that were opened. 

The top left subwindow shows the tree representation of all the commits and 
merges to the master branch. The top middle subwindow shows the author of the 
commit or merge, along with his/her email. The top right subwindow shows the 
date of the commit/merge.

There is a bar across the middle of the GUI showing the SHA ID for a 
selected commit/merge. It also gives the option to search through the whole
GUI for any keywords.

The bottom left side shows three subwindows; the top gives details about
a commit, including the author, parent and child commits, and branches. 
For example, the author was Trevor Murphy and the committer was 
Katsumi Yamaoka. The middle subwindow shows the ChangeLog for that commit, and
in this specific case, it shows that the mm-decode.el file was changed to
"Make non-string methods work." Lastly, the bottom subwindow shows the 
differences, in a '.el' file format, although the differences themselves are 
similar to the format resulted by from the diff command.

The bottom right side has a subwindow that contains a comment section, outlining
the files displayed on the bottom left side. In this case, lisp/gnus/ChangeLog 
and list/gnus/nnimap.el are shown.
