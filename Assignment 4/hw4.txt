Homework Answers:
1. The patch did improve the performance of ls because now the command is more consistent when used with flags in a given order.
   In terms of time, I not 100% but I believe it is slower because now it has to check whether or not the '.' and '..' directories are there.

2. Coreutils may or may not override some files or something when introduced.

3. When ran with dev/null, there are no issues. An issue appears when the generator.chooseline() is ran. /dev/null is opened with open(), and 
   then the lines inside the file are stored in a variable. random.choice is then called on that variable. The error is that there are no lines
   in the dev/null file, so random.choice can't select anything.

4. When the script is ran with Python 3, there is a syntax error at the beginning of the try-except block that comes after the arguments and 
   when the options have been processed. I believe this is just because of a change in syntax from Python 2 to Python 3.

5. After testing my shuf.py script with Python 2 and Python 3, I believe it is backwards compatible as there were no major difference or errors.
   String behavior is essentially the same, just with different encodings.
